This Is a Filament cutter I have designed for VzBot Printhead (https://github.com/VzBoT3D/Vz-Printhead-CNC) series and is a direct replacement for the VzBot Adapter Plate adding 2mm to the hotend length. The Magneto Filament Cutter is compatible with Vz-Printhead  with long Goliath (or any other hotend other than Short Goliath).
To be transparent I was heavily inspired by Magnus Hansson and Francois Lamarche's design from the HevORT group. This project would not be possible without the outstanding help and assistance from Mellow3D & BTT/Biqu!
