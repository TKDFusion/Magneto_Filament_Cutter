# Magneto_Filament_Cutter
This Is a Filament cutter I have designed for VzBot Printhead (https://github.com/VzBoT3D/Vz-Printhead-CNC) series and is a direct replacement for the VzBot Adapter Plate adding 2mm to hotend length.
To be transparent I was heavily inspired by Magnus Hansson and Francois Lamarche design from the HevORT group. This project would not be possible without the outstanding help and assistance from BTT/Biqu!
