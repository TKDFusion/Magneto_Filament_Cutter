# VzBot Magneto Filament Cutter

Blades are meant to be the Excel #17A narrow blade.
Due to global constraints, it is also compatible with other #17 & #4 hobby knife blades.

Once blades are sourced, they will need to be cut at 17mm length. Due to the blade's hardness, this is actually easier. You can score it at 17mm with a Dremel, and when you go to bend it, the blade will snap at the score mark.
